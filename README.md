# Video Depth Map -- CS179 Project

Real-time video depth map generation using Python and CUDA.

### Dependencies:

Pip-able dependencies are listen in `requirements.txt`. However, this project
also depends on OpenCV with python3 libraries.

This project uses Python3.4, and as such, we had to use OpenCV 3.0.0-rc1, 
compiled from source on Ubuntu 15.05 (x64). The installation script, opencv.sh, 
is available in `misc/`. Script was obtained from ** INSERT WEBSITE HERE **.
