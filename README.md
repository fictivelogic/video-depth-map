# Video Depth Map -- CS179 Project

Real-time video depth map generation using Python and CUDA.

### Dependencies:

Pip-able dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. However, this project
also depends on OpenCV.

Using Python3.4, we chose to use OpenCV 3.0.0-rc1,
compiled from source on Ubuntu 15.04 (x64). The installation script, opencv.sh, 
is available in `misc/`. 
Script was obtained from https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OpenCV
